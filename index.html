   <h1>RMS Voltage and Current Measurement Using ESP32</h1>
   <div class="content1">
       <h3> Motivation </h3>
       <ul> 
          <li> ESP32 does not support floating-point operation inside an interrupt service routine (ISR), then any calculations inside an ISR have to be done in fixed-point arithmetic.</li>
		  <li> Basic fixed-point arithmetic operations are easy to implement in C language, but you need yet to calculate the square root.  Until the moment this page was written, it hasn't found any ESP32 fixed-point library to do that.</li>
          <li> Considering the moving average filter with sample rate synchronized by a timer interrupt in RMS calculations, in order to keep the calculations in float on ESP32, some strategy is needed.  </li>
          <li> In this context, this project presents a proposal de calculate RMS values in ESP32.</li>
       </ul>

        <h3> Voltage/Current Sensors and Signal Conditioning  </h3>
		<ul>
           <li>In order to get the experimental results, in this proposal, LV20-P and LA55-P were used, voltage and current hall sensors, respectively. </li>
           <li>The use of hall sensors is recommended since they provide the galvanic isolation and typically present a high bandwidth response. </li>
           <li>The voltage sensor LV 20-P is in fact a hall sensor for a low current level. Because of this it is expensive. See a way to have a cheaper voltage sensor in <a href="https://ernane-aac.github.io/RMS-Voltage-Measurement/">Differential Voltage Sensor</a>. </li>

        <h3> Moving Average Scheme for RMS Calculations Considering The Previous Summations of Digital Samples </h3>
		<ul>
           <li>In the present proposal, the summations for average calculations will be done by an ISR using integer arithmetic. </li>
           <li>The further calculations to get the RMS values will be done in floating-point arithmetic inside a specific task. </li>
           <li>For that reason, the conventional equation to calculate the RMS values seen in Fig.2 will be changed to that one shown in Fig. 3. </li>
           <li>This implies that two circular buffers are necessary, one to store the samples and other for square samples, as we can see in Fig. 4.  </li>
		   <li>The same strategy can be used for current measurements. </li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
           <li>It is important to emphasize that this calculation strategy is only to circumvent the impossibility of calculating in floating point inside a ISR presented by ESP32.</li>
		   <li>Of course we have other strategies for sampling synchronization, like the use of millis() or esp_timer_get_time(), which use the simple equation seen in Fig. 2, but with a timer interrupt we have a more precise sampling rate.</li>
           <li>If you want a more professional voltmeter, it is recommended to change the microcontroller to one with a more linear adc conversion curve,  with an adc triggered by a timer and interrupt resquested by the end-of-conversion event, besides of the desired resolution and capability of float operations within the ISR.  </li>
           <li>Considering a low cost voltmeter, on which you can get the RMS values using a simple LCD or using a web browser in computer or cell-phone, the ESP32 presents an interesting cost-benefit. </li>

        <h3> ESP32 Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) </h3>
		<ul>
           <li>ESP32 has two analog-to-digital converters: ADC1 and ADC2. It is not possible to use ADC2 and Wifi or Bluetooth simultaneously. </li>
           <li>GPIO0 (ADC2_1), GPIO2 (ADC2_2),  GPIO12 (ADC2_5) and GPIO15 (ADC2_3) are used as strapping pins to configure the boot. In order to use these ADC channels, an external hardware scheme is necessary to keep the boot configuration (external multiplexer). </li>
           <li>Unfortunately, according the Espressif Documentation, it seems that the ESP32 ADC's don't support hardware trigger (timers), neither hardware interrupt for end-of-conversion event. In order to see how these resources are interesting, see the page <a href="https://ernane-aac.github.io/RMS-Voltage-Measurement/">RMS Voltage Measurement Using Arduino UNO</a> where an example for the Atmega328P is presented. 
           <li>Therefore, you have to use a function with a software start-of-conversion and a software handshaking to get the sample when it is ready. </li>
           <li>Considering the default configuration for the adc, analogRead() function takes around 52 microseconds to return the sample while  adc1_get_raw(channel) function takes around 36 microseconds. As you can use ESP-IDF functions inside a Arduino program, the second option is recommended, but don't forget to include the respective library. </li>
		   <li>For a 60 Hz electrical system, 100 samples per period in RMS calculations implies a sampling rate of 6 kHz. Considering the acquisition of two channels and getting samples with adc1_get_raw(channel), only the sample acquisitons take 72 microseconds, which is almost a half of sampling period (166.67us). Take this limitation into account when choosing the sampling rate and the number of channels to acquire, in order to enable the real-time execution of code. Keep in mind that there are several concurrent tasks. </li>
         </ul>

        <h3> ESP32 and the FreeRTOS </h3>
		<ul>
           <li>FreeRTOS is an real time operating system for microcontrollers (open source).</li>
		   <li>ESP32 runs over FreeRTOS considering a default tick of 100 Hz, then it is not possible to transfer data between tasks in higher rates. </li>
           <li>As the purpose of this project is  to calculate and show the RMS values to the user, the data will be updated at each half second. Do not use a faster update, since the task that consume data can not follow the producer.</li>
		</ul>

        <h3> Recommendations </h3>
       <ul> 
          <li> Considering the ESP32 devKitC board, there are three mutually exclusive options to provide power:</li>
		  <ul>
		     <li> Micro USB port, default power supply </li>
			 <li>5V / GND header pins  </li>
			 <li>3V3 / GND header pins </li>
		  </ul>
          <li>UseÂ one and only one of the options above! </li>
		  <li>The serial communication presented in the code example shown below is used only for debugging purpose. In normal operation it is better to disconnect the USB cable and use a high quality power source to supply the ESP32, since this will provide a better voltage reference to the ADC, implying the a better measurement accuracy. </li>
          <li>In the code example presented below, the ESP32 wifi is configured as access point, but you can change the code to station mode easily, if you intend to use a local network. </li>
          <li>The ESP32 code example presents a simple web page written in html. Pay attention in the details, as the C language commands are being used to insert the html code in a string variable, some differences appear, as instance, in the use of double quotation marks, since they have a meaning in the C language and in html. The '/' is used to force the C to ignore it, when it is used for html purpose.</li>
          <li>The web page generated by the server is shown in Fig. 5. </li>
